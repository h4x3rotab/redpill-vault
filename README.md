# redpill-vault

Redpill-vault is a secure credential manager for all your AI tools. It stores your API keys and context safely, so you never re-enter them between sessions, and they never touch LLM chats.

Your keys are encrypted and sync privately across your devices. Stop pasting keys. Start coding.
